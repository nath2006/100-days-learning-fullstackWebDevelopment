# On this session, i'm learn about Refactoring Code

## What is Refactoring?
> Refactoring is the process of restructuring code, while not changing its original functionality. 
## What is the purpose of refactoring?
> Refactoring improves code by making it:
<br>
    1. More efficient by addressing dependencies and complexities.
<br>
    2. More maintainable or reusable by increasing efficiency and 
       readability.
<br>
    3. Cleaner so it is easier to read and understand.
<br>
    4. Easier for software developers to find and fix bugs or 
    vulnerabilities in the code.

## When should code be refactored?
> For me, refactoring the code when we have finished the 'product' that we made, because it aims to familiarize and make it easier for us later when accessing our code.
